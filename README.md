  # Project Motivation.
  For this project , I was interested in using the Seattle's Airbnb listings data from kaggle to answer the following questions:
    - Is there a significant difference in the distribution of ammenities among properties with different price range?
    - Is there a significant difference in ratings distribution pattern in respect to price?
    - What features are the most positively related to the rental price of different properties?
Machine learning projects
This first project is part of the requirement for course completion for the Udacity Term 2 Data Science nanodegree program.
It involves following the CRISP-DM process in analysing the Seattle's Airbnb listings data and answering business questions alongside.
The data used is also included as well as the code for analysis.
