  # Project Motivation
  For this project , I was interested in using the Seattle's Airbnb listings data from kaggle to answer the following questions:
  
    - Is there a significant difference in the distribution of ammenities among properties with different price range?
    
    - Is there a significant difference in ratings distribution pattern in respect to price?
    
    - What features are the most positively related to the rental price of different properties?
    
  # File Descriptions
